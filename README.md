JavaScript Homework - due date: 10/12/13

=========

This project is to use the multiple parts of JavaScript that you have learned and apply it. You will need to use the
web/google to learn how to reference JavaScript methods in order to implement some of the functionality for this
project - list.push() appends an item to the end of a array.


#Project To Do

1. Finish the addItem function that adds an item to our to do list.
2. Create a function called refreshList that will be called by other function to build out our list in the DOM. You will
need to access the DOM element/id named todo-list and add a html list to it.
3. Create a html button that when clicked will remove the last element of the list array object - Note: similar to add
item button.
4. Create a function called removeItem that will be called when the remove item button is pressed.
